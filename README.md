# Gaussian Mixture Models
Implementation of EM and DPMM (Dirichlet Process Mixture Model) algorithms for multivariate cluster analysis. Streamlined for Supervised-Unsupervised learning, made to work with csv files with labelled data

# How to use
The main class to be interacted with for general purpose clustering is in `Cluster.py`. Specifically in the `Clusterer()` class. The steps used to typically load a dataset, train the model, test the model, generate test visualisations, and store it are detailed below. Distinction will be made between the supervised-unsupervised (SU) learning and Cluster Identification (unsupervised) 

## Load CSV file
Ensure your csv file is row-wise (i.e. label and corresponding dataset belong in the same row). Column-wise loading will be added soon.
